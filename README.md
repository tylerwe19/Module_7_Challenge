# Module_7_Challenge
# Preparing for the Silver Tsunami

## Overview of Project

This analysis determines the number of retiring employees per title and identifies leaders that are eligible to participate in a mentorship to help onboard a lot of new employees.

### Results of Analysis

This analysis will help management forsee the number of employees at Pewlett-Hackard who are eligible for retirement. 
 1. As seen in the retiring_titles table, approximately 72K employees are retirement eligible.
[retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Module_7_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Data/retiring_titles.csv)
 2. As seen in the current_titles table there are approximately 240K current employees at Pewlett-Hackard.
[all_current_titles_table](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Module_7_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Data/all_current_titles_table.csv)
 * When comparing these two tables, you can see that approximately 30% of employees are eligible for retirement, which is a significant amount.
 3. As seen in the eligible mentors table, only 1549 employees are eligible to fulfill mentorship roles.
[eligible_mentors_table.csv](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Module_7_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Data/eligible_mentors_table.csv)
 * When comparing this table to the 1st table showing ~72K employees are eligible for retirement, there will be a need for mentors as new employees are onboarded to backfill the positions of those who retire.
 4. When you compare the [eligible_mentors_table.csv](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Module_7_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Data/eligible_mentors_table.csv) and the [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Module_7_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Data/retiring_titles.csv), you can see that there could be the most turnover among senior engineers, but the senior engineer role only has the 3rd most employees who are eligible to become mentors. 

## Summary
In conclusion, though not all retirement-eligible employees will retire all at once, 30% of all Pewlett-Hackard employees are eligible for retirement leaving the company vulnerable. Senior Engineers make up the most retirement eligible employees, but only have the 3rd most employees who are eligible to become mentors. As a result, in addition to promoting engineers into the senior engineer role, hiring senior engineers from the job market may be necessary to mitigate the high turnover. To further prepare for the Silver Tsunami:
 * A staffing analysis may be needed to assess if backfills are needed for every position is vacated from employees retiring. 
 * Connected to the above staffing analysis, it would be interesting to gain data that forecasts demand/workload for the next couple years to be intentional in backfilling positions.
 * Lastly, I created the [all_current_titles_table](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Module_7_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Data/all_current_titles_table.csv) and [eligible_mentors_table.csv](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Module_7_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Data/eligible_mentors_table.csv) to compare retirement eligible employees to the total employee population to determine the % retirement eligible employees make of the employee population. The eligible mentors table was used to see if the number of eligible mentors by title aligned with number of retirement-eligible employees by title.
